While laying in a hospital bed crying my eyes out, depressed and distraught due to my terrible injuries I sustained. I was devastated and felt abandoned. I prayed to God and asked what should I do. I found myself asking the nurse at the amazing Jefferson/Torresdale hospital for a phone to contact my family. A couple of days later I reached out to Attorney Lessin’s office. Mark immediately came to the hospital by my bedside. We had a brief conversation; he saw the horrific state I was in, he comforted me and told me to rest and work on my healing journey. Watching Mark leaving my room, I felt a little relieved and I knew I was in good hands. Three years later, two surgeries in, I’m not fully back completely, but I’m much stronger and mentally, emotionally stable enough to continue living my life to the best of my abilities. Of course, Attorney Lessin, Mark, and along with his amazing staff, especially Bonnie❤️ made sure I was okay and reassured me I will be able to live out the rest of my life comfortably. I will forever be grateful for the love and concern that was provided to me from Attorney Lessin’s office. If you ever feel like your attorney is not making you feel the way I describe my Attorneys and office staff made me feel, contact Lessin’s office immediately.',

He really knows his laws and case studies, easy to work with, very personable and pleasant. You don’t have to wait to get a response from Jeff or his staff. And gosh, his staff is amazing as well. He is upfront and honest and made navigating this ordeal much easier. As I said, I could go on and on. A lawsuit is never easy to go through, yet Jeff made it so much easier and less stressful. I felt like I had a friend, not just a lawyer. Jeff is dedicated and hardworking. I could not have had a better lawyer, and I was more than pleased with the final outcome. Thank you, Jeff Lessin!',
