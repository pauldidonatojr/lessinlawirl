            description: `When it comes to legal matters like these, our law firm operates on a contingent fee basis, ensuring your peace of mind. With this fee structure, you won't have to worry about attorney's fees until we successfully secure compensation for you. If, unfortunately, we are unable to obtain compensation, you won't be responsible for any attorney's fees.

Moreover, it's important to note that in certain cases, the court may award attorney's fees directly from the defendant, or we may negotiate a settlement where the defendant covers these fees. These awarded or received attorney's fees would be subtracted from any fees you owe us.

In essence, pursuing justice after facing instances of police misconduct or discrimination comes with minimal financial risk. Our contingent fee arrangement not only provides you with financial protection but also presents the opportunity to seek the justice you rightfully deserve and potentially receive substantial compensation for the damages you have endured. Contact our experienced legal team today to discuss your case and let us fight for your rights.`,
